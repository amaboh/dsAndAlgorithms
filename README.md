Data structure and algorithms practices 

Why are data structures and algorithms important to master as new developer? 

This is what this mini project is all about. Exploring and developing algorithms along the way inorder to anser this question. 

What does better implementation of code means? Thats the answer DSA seems aims to answer. What is that all?? U may be asking urself. Well yes my friend.

    - "Better" means faster tine to finish and to use less memory (RAM), although there is much stronger emphasis on the former. (Readability of code does NOT factor at all. Performance is king!). 

So time measurement is what matters! Yes but not time measurement in layman terms because manually testing the time of your code with each new implementation is not practical. This is where we need a more standard way to measure performance. Here comes Big O. 

What is Big O: Well before going to Big O, slow down buddy. Let's first talk about space and time complexity.

Each lesson would contain a different branch on the gitHub repo to ease accesability and understanding of the different problems addressed. 

Space Complexity: Measures howmuch memory do we need as input provided to our code gets larger.

Time Complexity: Measure howmuch runtime do we need as the input of our code gets larger.
